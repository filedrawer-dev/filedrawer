"""The guard in leftover_processes.py, which conftest.py gives every test, run on small
suites of its own beside a copy of conftest.py. A test or a module's fixtures that leave
a process running error at teardown, naming each process, and it is killed with its
process group. What a fixture stops at its own teardown, a module fixture's process kept
for later tests, and processes the test doesn't own are left alone.

leftover_processes.py is a copy of llm-toolbox's, changed there and copied back, which
the host can't import; these tests follow llm-toolbox's test_leftover_processes.py, so
change both. Here no wait has a deadline of its own (test_no_wall_clock_limits.py)."""
